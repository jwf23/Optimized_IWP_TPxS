# Data and models for generating optimized IWP TPxS lattices
This repository accompanies our presentation _Improving the Mechanical Response of the IWP Exo-skeletal Lattice Through Shape Optimization_ at Solid Freeform Fabrication 2023. We submitted an associated peer review manuscript to the conference proceedings and will include a link once it is released.

#### Overview
The unit cells in our study are optimized to minimize compliance and volume fraction under uniaxial compression. The resulting Pareto Optimal designs show 2â€“18% higher stiffness when compared to the un-optimized IWP exo-skeletal lattices at the same volume fraction. This work also serves as a demonstration of the optimization of TPMS-based lattices to specific loading conditions, which can then be used in part scale optimization enabling further performance gains.

#### This repository contains:
- Pareto_Optimal_Variables_and_VF.csv
  - A csv with the A, B, and t values used to model the 80 Pareto optimal lattices from our study as well as their Volume Fraction (VF).
- Fisher et al. Optimized IWP TPxS Generator.ntop
  - An nTop file that implements the 80 discreet Pareto optimal solutions for implicit modeling.
- Fisher et al. Sub-Optimal IWP TPxS Generator.ntop
  - An nTop file that implements the continuously variable sub-optimal fitting of points from the Pareto frontier. This is a tradeoff which allows smooth grading of the lattice volume fraction, but sacrifices some of the performance gained through optimization.
